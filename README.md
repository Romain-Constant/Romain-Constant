  Hey :wave: I'm Romain, a fullstack developer.
</p>
<p align="center">
Over the past 15 years, I've cultivated a diverse skill set at AG2R La Mondiale, focusing on customer relations, team management, project management, and training. My journey has also provided me with a solid foundation in Lean Management, a methodology that now guides every action I take. ðŸŒ±
</p>
  In 2022, my passion for technology led me to transition into a full-stack developer role, with a particular focus on the frontend.

  Drawing on my strategic management vision, I apply these skills as a developer, optimizing collaboration within a team. My goal is to actively contribute to collective success, leveraging my management experience to strengthen group synergy. ðŸš€

  My approach is centered around performance, quality, and added value.

  Are you in search of a professional who combines business experience, technical skills, and creativity in development? Ready to tackle new challenges, I am available to discuss my potential contribution to your team.

  As an aspiring craftsman, I am dedicated to exploring and mastering best practices such as clean code, clean architecture, TDD, katas, among others... ðŸ’»âœ¨
